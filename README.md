# biodiversity-project
A CodeCademy Project to analyse biodiversity and conservation status of various species across national parks in the US

# Was given two files with data about species and observations from 4 major national parks in the US.
Observations.csv contains information about every observations at each of the four parks in the span of one week. 
It contains information about the number of observations, the name of the species, and the name of the park.
It is comprised of 23,000+ rows and 3 columns.

Species_info.csv is a file that contains information about the scientific name of every species in the observations dataset, the common names for each species, the category of each species, and the cosnervation status.
It has 5,800+ rows and 4 columns.
Used a combination of the two files to find descriptive statistics and answer certain questions about the dataset.
Used Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib to organize, and graph the data through various methods including stacked bar charts, lien graphs, swarm plots, and more.

Example Questions include:
What is the most observed animal in all the parks and what is its conservation status?
What is the spread of conservations status across different categories of species?
Are the differences between conservation status of categories statistically significant?
